# Hawaii Vacation

My wife and I took a wonderful vacation to Oahu last year which was amazing, and I hoped to share a little about it here.

## Food

The food was absolutely amazing. Some of our favorite places to eat included:
* Giovanni's Shrimp Truck
* Leonard's Bakery
* Marukame Udon

## Entertainment

By far the most excitiing thing we did was Shark cage diving. Don't worry about not seeing any, they have a guarantee.
> CAGE DIVING WITH SHARKS
> 100% GUARANTEED SHARK SIGHTINGS

If I had to rank the tourist activities, they would be:
1. Shark Cage Diving
2. Scuba Diving
3. Hiking
4. Hanauma Bay
